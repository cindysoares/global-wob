# Global W.O.B

Deployed in https://globalwob.herokuapp.com/

This is a project submitted to the WVEF Tech Chalenge 2015. We have joined ITC, Google and CI&T to create a digital platform for woman-owned business (WOBs) accross the world. (http://www.intracen.org/news/Join-ITC-Google-and-CIT-for-the-WVEF-Tech-Challenge-to-help-women-entrepreneurs-trade-more-globally/) 

## Objective

We intend to develop a web application to connect WOBs, global companies, translators and entrepreneurs. WOBs will describe their activities, services and products and translators will offer their services to globalize this information. Global companies will research for WObs using this app and entrepreneurs will support the negotiations between WOBs and global companies.
